## Set up a Pera Wallet

Pera Wallet is one of the wallets featured by Algorand. You can visit their [website](https://perawallet.app/) to learn more or to download.

To use the app, you will need to set a six-digit PIN number.

Next, you will need to add or generate an account.

![generate-account](/images/crypto/generate.jpg)

To do this, you will either import or generate a 25-word seed phrase. Write down your seed phrase and keep it in a safe place (not stored online). Never give it to anyone!

Next, you have the option to name your account (for example, ‘what happens next?’). The default name is the 58 character Algorand address.

> **_Optional:_** to ensure you have the seed phrase correct, remove your account and add it back by importing the seed phrase. Click on ‘...’ in the upper right corner, then ‘Remove Account’ in the menu that pops up, then ‘Remove’. Repeat the steps to add an account by selecting ‘I already have an account’, clicking ‘Recover an account’, and entering your seed phrase.

The account must be activated by receiving at least 0.1 ALGO. Each asset and application you opt into adds to the required minimum balance, so it is recommended that you fund the account with a few ALGO to explore the Algorand ecosystem. Send ALGO to the 58 character Algorand address from another wallet you own or from an exchange. 

ALGO can be purchased on any major *Centralized Cryptocurrency Exchange* (CEX). These include Coinbase, Binance, Crypto.com, Kraken, Kucoin, etc. 

Click on ‘...’ in the upper right corner, then ‘Copy Address’ in the menu that pops up. Paste this address as the receiver when you send ALGO.

Your account is now ready to receive and send ALGO!

## Opt into YARN

In order to receive and send Spindle Yarn, you will need to opt into it as an *Algorand Standard Asset* (ASA).

- Click on ‘Add New Asset’ next to the plus sign in the ‘Assets’ tab of your account.

- You can search for *spindle* or *yarn*. To make sure you have the right asset, look for the verification checkmark or search by the ASA ID# [544217506](https://algoexplorer.io/asset/544217506).

> **_Optional:_** If you would like to use Voting Cards, you can opt into those as well by going to the NFTs tab and using the same steps as above. You will have to opt into Spindle Voting Card A, B, C and D separately (ASA ID# [612495327](https://algoexplorer.io/asset/612495327), [612537774](https://algoexplorer.io/asset/612537774), [612546420](https://algoexplorer.io/asset/612546420), [612569810](https://algoexplorer.io/asset/612569810)).


## Swap ALGO for YARN on Tinyman

Go to https://app.tinyman.org/ and connect your Pera Wallet. In the upper right corner of the Pera Wallet app, there are the corners of a square with a horizontal line in the middle. Click this to scan the QR code that will appear on the screen when you click the ‘Connect Wallet’ button on the website. (If you are using MyAlgo wallet, you will be prompted to enter your password instead of using Wallet Connect). Before using Tinyman for the first time, you will need to opt in to the Tinyman application. Sign the transaction from your wallet (Note: this involves a 0.001 ALGO transaction fee).

Once your wallet is connected, go to the ‘Swap’ tab, and click inside the search bar for the token you are swapping to. Search for Spindle Yarn. Look for the verification checkmark and check the ASA ID# [544217506](https://algoexplorer.io/asset/544217506) - asset names and unit names can be repeated in the Algorand ecosystem, and scammers often create ASAs with similar names to verified tokens. Before making the purchase, you must opt in to the asset. If you have not yet opted in to YARN, click the blue ‘Opt in’ button below the purple box and complete the transaction in your wallet.

Enter the amount of ALGO you want to spend in the ‘From’ box. The amount of YARN you would receive at the current price is shown in the ‘To’ box.

*Minimum received*: the amount of YARN you are guaranteed to receive if the swap is successful (note that this is lower than the amount quoted in the ‘To’ box). If the price does not change while you are completing the swap, you will redeem the difference between the amount shown in the ‘To’ box and the ‘Minimum received’ as an excess amount later.

*Slippage tolerance*: the maximum % difference in quoted price and actual price you will tolerate (in the unfavorable direction). It can be set to any value between 0-100%. As slippage tolerance increases, the minimum received decreases. 0.5% is the default slippage on Tinyman. If the price change during the seconds it takes to complete the swap is larger than the slippage tolerance, the transaction will fail.

*Swap fee*: Tinyman charges a fee of 0.3% of the asset you are swapping from. For example, if you buy using 5 ALGO, the fee is 5 ALGO * 0.3% / 100% = 0.015 ALGO.

*Price impact*: the % increase your swap will have on the price of YARN. As the amount you are swapping increases or the size of the liquidity pool decreases, the price impact increases. If the price impact is greater than 5%, Tinyman will give a warning. For beginners, it is recommended to swap only if the price impact is less than 5%.

Click the blue ‘Swap’ button at the bottom of the page, then ‘Confirm swap’ on the next page. Sign the transaction in your wallet.

If the transaction was successful, you will get a confirmation screen with the transaction ID and an option to redeem your excess amount. Tip: If the excess amount is less than the 0.002 ALGO transaction fee or if you plan to make multiple purchases of the same asset (for example, if you want to DCA into YARN), you may want to wait to redeem it.

## Tip Creators or Buy Spindle Voting Cards

Now your YARN is ready to be used on the Spindle website!

Connect your wallet as before, and then navigate to a story and click on the ‘Tip YARN’ button at the bottom, directly under the wallet address of the creator.

If you want to use a Voting Card to tip a creator instead, or to vote on the outcome of a story, navigate to *Fiction > Voting Cards Swap* and click ‘Buy’ for the appropriate card.
