This guide covers:

- [Creator Rights](#creator-rights)
- [Monetization](#monetization)
- [Fiction Rules & Guidelines](#fiction-rules--guidelines)
- [Guide Links](#guide-links)

## Creator Rights
Every work of fiction on the Spindle website was uploaded with permission by the author/illustrator and the author/illustrator may remove their work at any time.

## Monetization
Currently, monetization through the Spindle platform can occur in these ways:

- [Tipping](#tipping)
- [Story Voting](#story-voting)
- [Storefronts / Illustration NFTs](#storefronts--illustration-nfts)
- [Proof-Reading](#proof-reading)
- [$YARN Rewards](#yarn-rewards)
- [Bounty Writing (Coming Soon)](#bounty-writing)
- [NFT-Locked Content (Coming Soon)](#nft-locked-content)

We plan to expand into other types of content as we grow as a platform. If you would like to have your story content NFT-locked or become a bounty writer, please contact us via [email](mailto:contact@spindle-asa.com) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn).

### Tipping
Every chapter will include a ‘Tip YARN’ button for readers to tip their favorite authors and stories. This tip button links to a wallet provided by the author so 100% of the tip goes directly to the author.

### Story Voting
Story Voting is an expansion of tipping; authors may choose to offer interactivity to their stories, where readers can ‘tip’ a 500 YARN Voting Card to influence the direction of the story. Authors choose up to four options and the amount of time the vote is open (minimum of 1 week and maximum of 4 weeks from the time of upload), and readers can cast their ballot during that time frame. Voting is at the discretion of the author and is not required. Authors of voting stories are not required to include a vote in every chapter.

Like with tipping, these cards go directly to the author’s wallet. Authors can then convert these votes back into 500 YARN each. Currently, Spindle takes no platform fees for card swapping, so 100% of the proceeds from voting go to the author.

The website program reads the voting information directly from the blockchain and the display is updated automatically when a new vote is sent. The letter boxes will be grayed out unless the reader has the respective voting card NFT – to swap YARN for a voting card, hit the ‘Swap Card’ link to navigate to the swap page.

Voting cards can be purchased with 500 YARN or a roughly equivalent value in ALGO, but can only be converted back into YARN. For more information on the voting cards, check out our [Expanded Guide: Voting](/voting.md).

Voting Stories have Ballot Indicators next to the ‘Read’ navigation, and if that indicator is green the voting is currently open for that story.

### Storefronts / Illustration NFTs

Storefronts are a way for creators to monetize their work and for readers to support their favorite authors and illustrators on Spindle. Content creators can sell NFTs related to their stories published on Spindle using the [Spindle Storefronts](https://www.spindle-asa.com/store). 

Only wallets whitelisted for stories published on Spindle can add NFT listings. If you want to whitelist a wallet for your story, contact us on the [Spindle Discord](https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn) or via [email](mailto:contact@spindle-asa.com).

The royalty functionality of the underlying smart contract allows to add multiple collaborators to a listing who can claim royalties from the sales. This way, co-authors, illustrators, etc. do not have to struggle to handle the payouts from sales.

For more information, check out our [Expanded Guide: Storefronts](/storefronts.md).

### Proofreading
Story proofreading and editing occur on channels on our Discord server exclusively for the authors. Proofreading chapters is often a swap between two authors but may be compensated with YARN or a Voting Card if a swap isn’t available. For more information, join the [Spindle Discord Server](https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn) to request access to the Storyteller’s channels.

### $YARN Rewards
Every uploaded chapter/illustration receives a YARN reward if that chapter passes Spindle quality standards and is greater than 1500 words. Chapters under 1500 words may still be uploaded but may not be eligible for a YARN reward.

This reward is just an incentive bonus and should not be considered payment for your work.

If your story or chapter is rejected, you’ll be given a reason and suggestions on corrections you could make to your work. Typically it just means more proofreading is needed. Help from fellow authors can be requested on the [Spindle Discord Server](https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn).

### Bounty Writing
As Spindle grows, other projects notice the quality of our work and some may want to hire writers for various tasks, with various levels of compensation. The *Expanded Guide: Hidden Stories* will be coming soon. If you’re interested in Bounty Writing, please contact us via [email](mailto:contact@spindle-asa.com) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn).

### NFT-Locked Content
If you’d like to lock your story content behind NFT purchases, please contact us via [email](mailto:contact@spindle-asa.com) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn).

## Fiction Rules & Guidelines

### Archiving
If a new chapter isn’t uploaded within six months a story may be archived. Archived works will be flagged for the benefit of the reader, but the author may still update them and move them out of the archive. Illustration NFTs, if any, will remain available. Authors may elect to have their story moved into ‘Archived Fiction’ if they have no plans to continue progressing that body of work.

### Content Restrictions
Spindle is not accepting fanfiction or graphic NSFW content at this time. We encourage authors to explore all subjects and will not censor topics, but may request a trigger warning or reject anything we feel should be restricted to an 18+ audience.

### Submitting Fiction
Spindle has locked Discord channels for brainstorming, proofreading, and editing content. Joining our server is encouraged for anyone wanting to upload fiction to Spindle, but is not mandatory. You can join the [Spindle Discord Server](https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn) to request access to the Storyteller’s channels.

If you want to contribute fiction but don’t want to join the server, email us for more information: [contact@spindle-asa.com](mailto:contact@spindle-asa.com).

### Incorporating the Algorand Blockchain
You don’t need an Algorand wallet to enjoy our public fiction content, but you will if you’d like to interact on the platform. If you want to participate but don’t know how to set up an Algorand wallet, please [contact us](mailto:contact@spindle-asa.com) or check out our [Beginner’s Guide to Crypto](/crypto.md).
