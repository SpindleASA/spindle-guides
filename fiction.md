## Creator Rights

Every work of fiction on the Spindle Website was uploaded with permissions by the author/illustrator and the author/illustrator may remove their work at any time.

## Monetization

Currently, monetization occurs in these ways:

- [Tipping](#tipping)
- [Story Voting](#story-voting)
- [Illustration NFTs](#illustration-nfts)
- [Proof-Reading](#proof-reading)
- [$YARN Rewards](#yarn-rewards)
- [Bounty Writing](#bounty-writing)
- [NFT-Locked Content](#nft-locked-content)

We plan to expand into other types of content as we grow as a platform.

### Tipping
Every chapter will include a `Tip YARN` button for readers to tip their favorite authors and stories. This tip button links to a wallet provided by the author so 100% of the tip goes directly to the author.

### Story Voting

Story Voting is an expansion of tipping; authors may choose to offer interactivity to their stories, where readers can ‘tip’ a 500 YARN Voting Card to influence the direction of the story. Authors choose all four options and the amount of time the vote is open (minimum of 1 week and maximum of 4 weeks from the time of upload), and readers can cast their ballot during that time-frame. Voting is at the discretion of the author and is not required. Authors of voting stories are not required to include a vote every chapter.

Like with tipping, these cards go directly to the author’s wallet. Authors can then convert these votes back into 500 YARN each. Currently, Spindle takes no platform fees for card swapping, so 100% of the proceeds from voting goes to the author.

The website program reads the voting information directly from the blockchain and the display is updated automatically when a new vote is sent. The letter boxes will be grayed out unless the reader has the respective voting card NFT – to swap YARN for a voting card, hit the ‘Swap Card’ link to navigate to the swap page.

Voting cards can be purchased with 500 YARN or 2 ALGO, but can only be converted back into YARN. For more information on the voting cards, check out our Expanded Guide: Voting Cards [insert link].

Voting Stories have Ballot Indicators next to the ‘Read’ navigation, and if that indicator is green the voting is currently open for that story.

### Illustration NFTs

Currently Illustration NFTs are only sold by the authors/artists on their respective external storefronts, but Spindle aims to implement an internal storefront for selling Illustration NFTs sometime this summer. This will be an optional service.

In the meantime, we’ll be creating author/story profile pages for everyone to link to their external shops, social media, personal pages, etc.

### Proof-Reading

Story proof-reading and editing occurs on the Storyteller’s Guild, a Discord server exclusively for the authors. Proof-reading chapters is often a swap between two authors, but may be compensated with YARN or a Voting Card if a swap isn’t available. For more information, join the Spindle Main server to request access to the Storyteller’s Guild: https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn

### $YARN Rewards

Every uploaded chapter/illustration receives a Yarn reward if that chapter passes Spindle quality standards and is greater than 1500 words. Chapters under 1500 words may still be uploaded but may not be eligible for a Yarn reward.

This reward is just an incentive bonus and should not be considered as a payment for your work.

If your story or chapter is rejected, you’ll be given a reason and suggestions on corrections you could make to your work. Typically it just means more proof-reading is needed. Help from fellow authors can be requested on the Spindle Discord Server: https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn

### Bounty Writing

As Spindle grows, other projects notice the quality of our work and some may want to hire writers for various tasks, with various levels of compensation. If you’re interested in Bounty Writing, contact us or check out our Expanded Guide: Hidden Stories [Coming soon!].

### NFT-Locked Content

If you’d like to lock your story content behind NFT purchases, please contact us. This service should be available over the next few months.

## Fiction Rules & Guidelines

### Archiving

If a new chapter isn’t uploaded within six months a story may be archived. Archived works will be flagged for the benefit of the reader, but the author may still update them and move them out of the archive. Illustration NFTs, if any, will remain available. Authors may elect to have their story moved into ‘Archived Fiction’ if they have no plans to continue progressing that body of work.

### Content Restrictions

Spindle is not accepting fanfiction or graphic NSFW content at this time. We encourage authors to explore all subjects and will not censor topics, but may request a trigger warning or reject anything we feel should be restricted to an 18+ audience.

### Submitting Fiction

Spindle has a private Discord for brainstorming, proof-reading, and editing content. Joining this server is encouraged for anyone wanting to upload fiction to Spindle, but is not mandatory. You can join the main server here to request access to the private server: [https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn](https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn)

If you want to contribute fiction but don’t want to join the server, email us for more information: [contact@spindle-asa.com](mailto:contact@spindle-asa.com)

### Incorporating the Algorand Blockchain

You don’t need an Algorand wallet to enjoy our public fiction content, but you will if you’d like to interact on the platform. If you want to participate but don’t know how to set up an Algorand wallet, please contact us or check out our Beginner’s Guide to Crypto [here](/crypto.md)
