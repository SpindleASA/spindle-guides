## About Voting Cards
Spindle Voting Cards are a set of multi-mint NFTs with a specified value and voting option. These can be used to cast ballots in interactive stories, compensate proof-readers, or even just as a little tip to authors. 

These cards can be purchased for 500 YARN or a roughly equivalent value in ALGO, and are available on the Spindle website as well as various Spindle external storefronts such as AB2, AlgoGems, and Crescendo Marketplace. Cards may be swapped back into 500 YARN at any time on the Spindle website. They may not be swapped back into ALGO, GEMS, or CRSD.


## Support the Authors
Some authors write traditional stories and rely on tips and other monetization methods, but some authors include interactivity in their stories where the reader can vote on the progression of the plot or the decisions of the characters. Every chapter of every story links directly to the author’s wallet, so every tip and voting card is sent directly to the author. The author can then convert these votes back into 500 YARN per card; there’s no fee for tipping or voting, so 100% of the proceeds go to the author.


## How to Vote
If a story has voting open, the ballot indicator next to the ‘Read’ navigation will be green. Authors may have their ballots open for 1-4 weeks.

The voting options, current results, and beginning/end dates will be displayed at the bottom of the relevant chapter. You’ll have to connect your wallet via Wallet Connect to cast your ballot. 
Just click ‘Connect Wallet’ to link up to MyAlgo Wallet or Pera Wallet.

If you don’t have a Voting Card NFT in your wallet, the option will be disabled. Click on ‘Swap Cards’ to navigate to the *Fiction > Cards & Voting* page to get the voting card you want to send.

On the Spindle website, cards may be purchased with 500 YARN or a roughly equivalent value in ALGO.

Cards may be swapped back into 500 YARN at any time, but cannot be swapped back into ALGO.

Once you have your card, you can navigate back to the story to cast your ballot! This transfers the card directly from your wallet to the author’s wallet.

The results display reads the information directly from the blockchain, so the new votes are shown right away!

Authors may transfer or sell cards immediately without affecting the vote tally.

And that’s it! Authors will use the results of the vote to write the next chapter in their interactive saga!
