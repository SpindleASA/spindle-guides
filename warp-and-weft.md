## About Warp & Weft

Warp & Weft is a monthly ASA zine written by Spindle community members and contributors throughout the Algorand ecosystem. The contents of this zine vary from month-to-month, but generally include a couple of broad market articles, tons of news from Algorand projects, book reviews from the Spindle clubs, short stories, and artistic features from individual creators. Warp & Weft holders are also eligible for a multitude of giveaways and the occasional staking pool! Each single edition may be purchased on the Spindle website for 3 ALGO or a roughly equivalent amount of YARN, and may also be available on our various storefronts: AB2, Rand Gallery, AlgoGems, and Crescendo Marketplace.

## Features

### Project Spotlight Article
The Project Spotlight is the main feature of each zine, chosen by Spindle. A W&W journalist will interview the project creator and compile that into a 2-3 page article about that project. The project will also receive the clean cover NFT as a keepsake and a stack of zines to give out to their community. Spotlight features cannot be purchased.

May’s Spotlight Article features The AlgoFaucet in a 3-page interview with founder Big Bang Flash.

### Project Sponsorships
Project Sponsorships are purchased articles, and will be clearly labeled as paid features. These help fund Warp & Weft journalists and allow us to continue expanding! Each month will only feature one main sponsor, which will receive a 2 page article, an icon on the front cover, a stack of zines to give out to their community, and the option to distribute their token through W&W staking to reach a new audience. Sponsorships are currently 100 ALGO, please contact us via [email](mailto:contact@spindle-asa.com) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn) if your project is interested in sponsoring an issue!

### Block Advertisements
Block Advertisements are smaller, paid ads towards the back of Warp & Weft. Block advertisements may be full page, half page, a third page, or a quarter page, depending on how many advertisements are submitted. They will not be smaller than a quarter page. Block advertisements may be designed by Spindle if a pre-made design isn’t available, and will include clickable links to the project’s Discord server, website, and social media pages. Block advertisements are currently 20 ALGO.

May’s issue had two project advertisers so each project received half a page, designed by KC with the input of the project creators. Advertisements are always clearly labeled. 

### ASA/NFT Round-ups
Each issue has at least 4 pages of round-up news from projects within the Algorand community. These round-ups are 1-2 paragraphs containing project news and immediate goals. NFT round-ups often include a picture and all include an invite to the project’s Discord server, if publicly available.

Rach’s NFT Round-up from April’s issue had a page of new releases and a page of updates from older NFT projects.

### Dox Talk
Dox Talk is a doxxed interview with a project creator, in which the creator shares their real name and a photo of themselves. These creators may or may not already be doxxed, but it helps them notify a larger audience of their doxxed status. The Dox Talk also features some fun factoids about your favorite project creators!

### Other Contents
The following clip of the Table of Contents from the April issue shows the variety of articles in each issue of Warp & Weft, from book club reviews to news to fiction! If you’d like to have content featured, please contact us via [email](mailto:contact@spindle-asa.com) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn).
