## What is Spindle ASA?
ASA stands for Algorand Standard Asset, and represents the part of Spindle built on the Algorand Blockchain. This includes our YARN token and all of our NFTs.


## Why use the blockchain?
There are many benefits to blockchain technology that helps authors:
- Quick, seamless transfer of value from one wallet to another, with no middlemen
- The ability to transfer and resell digital assets, such as eBooks and Warp & Weft, on a second-hand market
- The ability to conduct transactions safely and anonymously, without connecting your bank. This allows readers to support authors with just a click of a few buttons.
- Minimal fees!
- Royalty payouts to authors and asset holders
- Platform Transparency – all of Spindle’s transactions are visible on the ledger, so ‘bad acting’ is evident and traceable
- Internationality

At Spindle, we believe blockchain technology is the future path for many industries, but most especially for digital creative content. Attaching assets to our creative work allows us to monetize content online in a way that was previously difficult. Fans can buy that asset easily – whether it’s an eBook cover, a song, an illustration, or a token – and really own it. They can gift it, trade it, or resell it, much like physical items. Creators can also easily reward the holders of these assets. For more information, see our [Beginner’s Guide to Crypto](/crypto.md).


## Why Algorand?
*Algorand just works.*

Algorand is professional, reliable, and cheap to use on a large scale. Algorand is also incredibly eco-conscious, and the community within Algorand puts a large emphasis on carbon offsets and green practices. There are many blockchains to build on, but we believe Algorand has the best all around technology, affordability, and ethics.  


## What is Spindle Yarn?
YARN, $YARN, or Spindle Yarn is *Algorand Standard Asset* ID# [544217506](https://algoexplorer.io/asset/544217506), a cryptocurrency token on the Algorand blockchain. Having a token allows Spindle and the community to transact with each other quickly and easily. Sub-tokens like YARN can be thought of as platform currency, or an in-game currency, which users may purchase to interact with the website. The benefit of a blockchain token is that all transactions are visible on the ledger, so the risk of ‘bad acting’ is greatly reduced.


## Why use NFTs?
We want you to own the assets you purchase, even the digital ones. eBooks, illustrations, even zines, should be yours to hold, gift, or sell, at your discretion.

Even more importantly, we want to have the option of including rewards, royalties, and other benefits to purchasers and holders of these assets, and NFTs allow us to do that in a unique and seamless way. 

NFTs – and other cryptocurrencies – are also international, meaning you can send value across continents with the same low transaction fee as sending it to your neighbor.


## How to Purchase YARN and Spindle NFTS
YARN must be purchased using Algorand’s native token ALGO. 

ALGO can be purchased on any major *Centralized Cryptocurrency Exchange* (CEX). These include Coinbase, Binance, Crypto.com, Kraken, Kucoin, etc. 

Once purchased, the ALGO must be transferred to an Algorand ecosystem wallet, such as Pera Wallet (mobile) or MyAlgo Wallet (desktop). This transfer is easy, fast, and has almost no fee.

Once your ALGO is in your ecosystem wallet, you can swap that ALGO for ecosystem sub-tokens, such as YARN, using a Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchange (DEX). The main DEX for Algorand is Tinyman.org. 

Most or all Spindle NFTs are available for purchase in both YARN and ALGO, so you may not even need to swap! Just connect your wallet on the Spindle Website to make transactions.
