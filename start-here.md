## Stories

Every work of fiction on the Spindle Website was uploaded with permissions by the author/illustrator and the author/illustrator may remove their work at any time.

Every uploaded chapter/illustration receives a Yarn reward if that chapter passes Spindle quality standards and is greater than 1500 words. Chapters under 1500 may still be uploaded but may not be eligible for a Yarn reward.

If a new chapter isn’t uploaded within six months a story may be archived. Archived works will be flagged for the benefit of the reader, but the author may still update them and move them out of the archive.

Spindle is not accepting fanfiction or graphic NSFW content at this time. We encourage authors to explore all subjects and will not censor topics, but may request a trigger warning or reject anything we feel should be restricted to an 18+ audience.

Spindle has a community Discord for brainstorming, proof-reading, and editing content. Joining the server is encouraged for anyone wanting to upload fiction to Spindle, but is not mandatory. You can join us [here](https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn).

If you want to contribute fiction but don’t want to join the server, email us for more information: [contact@spindle-asa.com](mailto:contact@spindle-asa.com).

You don’t need an Algorand wallet to enjoy our public fiction content, but you will if you’d like to interact on the platform. If you want to participate but don’t know how to set up an Algorand wallet, check out our [Beginner’s Guide to Crypto](/crypto.md) or [contact us](mailto:contact@spindle-asa.com) for help.

## Voting

Authors may or may not include a voting element in their stories, and votes may occur as frequently or infrequently as the author wishes. Voting encourages audience participation and the voting cards may be swapped for Yarn, adding an extra bit of monetization for the author.

Voting stories may leave their vote open for a minimum of 1 week and a maximum of 4 weeks. All voting is transparent, so an author offering voting is committed to following the outcome of the vote, whatever that may be.

More expensive voting cards may be added in the future for more influential story decisions. For more information, check out our [Expanded Guide: Voting Cards](/voting.md).

## Illustrations

Spindle is looking for illustrators! If you’d like to provide illustrations for stories, NFT projects, or any Spindle-related content, let us know on the [Spindle Discord](https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn) or via [email](mailto:contact@spindle-asa.com). Illustrations may also be eligible for Yarn rewards. For more information, check out our [Expanded Guide: Illustrations](/illustrations.md).

## Hidden Stories & Bounty Writing

Hidden Stories are collaborations with other projects and individuals in which bonus written content is attached to an NFT. That content is decided by the respective author and NFT/Project creator, and may vary widely. If you’re interested in writing or having your content written, please contact us on the [Spindle Discord](https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn) or via [email](mailto:contact@spindle-asa.com)! For more information, check out our [Expanded Guide: Hidden Stories](/hidden-stories.md).

## Warp & Weft

Warp & Weft is a monthly ASA zine featuring Algorand community news, ASA/NFT updates, and project interviews, as well as creative content and fiction from the Spindle community. Each month’s issue is unlocked using the cover NFT, which makes that issue readable in PDF format.

Warp & Weft is not actively looking for article writers, but if you have something specific you would like to contribute, own a project you would like to be featured, or if you’d like to become a sponsor, please contact us on the [Spindle Discord](https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn) or via [email](mailto:contact@spindle-asa.com)! For more information, check out our [Expanded Guide: Warp & Weft](/warp-and-weft.md).

**Publishers:** Pteratato#6575 and Rach#2348

## Spindle ASA & $YARN Token

You don’t need an Algorand wallet to enjoy our public fiction content, but you will if you’d like to interact on the platform. If you want to participate but don’t know how to set up an Algorand wallet, check out our [Beginner’s Guide to Crypto](/crypto.md) or [contact us](mailto:contact@spindle-asa.com) for help.

Spindle Yarn (ASA ID# 544217506) is a token created to interact with the Spindle platform and to allow us to experiment with currency swap. Spindle Yarn is not an investment token, is not used for governance, and should not be considered to have value outside of the Spindle platform. Spindle Yarn is used to incentivize participation in the Spindle Discord and the Spindle Platform and primarily exists as a currency to be used on Spindle creative content and services.

There are no staking rewards for Yarn other than for providing liquidity to our Tinyman pool, but you may use Yarn to hire writers and editors to help with your individual projects. For more information, join the [Spindle Discord](https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn) or contact us through [email](mailto:contact@spindle-asa.com). For more information, check out our [Expanded Guide: Spindle ASA](/spindle.md).

## Social Clubs

Yarn may also be earned by participating in a Spindle Discord Club. The Spindle Community is currently hosting a book club, graphic novel club, Benny Beardsley Adventures writing club, and a daily prompt-based writing club. Join the [Spindle Discord](https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn) to join any of these clubs!

## Coming Soon!

Spindle is looking to simultaneously expand the content we currently offer (fiction, Warp & Weft), as well as increase our available projects. We’re currently working on collectable NFTs, Lit RPG Games, royalty functions, and website features. If you have suggestions or would like to work on Spindle, please contact us on the [Spindle Discord](https://discord.gg/D8P9esv6Vn) or via [email](mailto:contact@spindle-asa.com).
